Simple Routing Web Project:

Main AIM: The goal of this project is to reduce manual efforts of users when visiting multiple websites.

HTML5 and CSS were used in one of my web projects. Therefore, I integrated all data into one site using simple Logos. Clicking on a particular logo will redirect the user to the corresponding site's home page.
Users will be able to get all the information they need at once. I used Css and HTML5 for this project and learned more UI skills while doing this project. Learned various tags and other important parameters in HTML5, which will help me to understand other UI projects easily. In the CSS part, I learned styling and applying various styles to different objects. I designed a routing mechanism based on simple Logos, So everybody can understand easily and they can navigate to the required site.
